## modulate

modulate is a generic lightweight AMD loader. It uses plugins to implement module loading. There are no default plugins. It is also EXTREMELY early in development; as in, haven't even actually looked at the AMD spec yet, so please don't use it.


### TODO:

1. need to support [this bullshit](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/blob/252355fb785b65ba3ddc18430866cf0584fcd8e3/require.js#L2015). Who though the best way to support this was function string parsing? can we shoot them?
